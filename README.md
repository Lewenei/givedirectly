* GiveDirectly-Inspired WordPress Theme
This is a custom WordPress theme inspired by GiveDirectly.org and made from a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`. I designed this theme following an open position for WordPress Engineer at GiveDirectly! Hope I will get hired 🤞🏾. 

* Features
Responsive Design: Fully mobile-friendly with collapsible navigation.
Custom Donate Button: Prominent and customizable "Donate" button in the header.
Customizable Navigation: Supports WordPress menu system for easy navigation customization.
Custom Logo: Easily upload your logo via the WordPress customizer.
Widget Ready: Add widgets to the footer or sidebar as needed.
Clean Code: Built using _S (Underscores) starter theme as a base for modern WordPress development.

* Installation
Clone the repository or download the theme as a ZIP file:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/givedirectly-theme.git
```
Move the theme folder to your WordPress wp-content/themes/ directory:
```sh
$ mv givedirectly-theme /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/themes/
```

Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard, go to Appearance > Themes, and activate the "GiveDirectly-Inspired Theme."

Customize your site by navigating to Appearance > Customize.
